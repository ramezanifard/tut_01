#
# - if they are already initialized they are not re-initialized (this would cause their plunger to go back to volume=0)
# - before initializing the plunger, the valve is set to the position specified as 'initialize_valve_position'
#   this is defaulted to 'I' and is important as initialization with valve connected to a fluidic path characterized by
#   high pressure drop is likely to fail due to the relatively high plunger speeds normally used during initialization
